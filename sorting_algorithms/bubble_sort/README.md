# Bubble Sort


#### About

This is a rather popular sorting algorithm, not because it's good (it's actually really... really...... really......... slow.........................)

It's a good algorithm to start with because of how simple it is - just go through the list of things that have to be sorted, and if any adjacent items are out of order, swap them. Do that enough times, and voil&agrave;!



#### Origin

Probably the earliest reference to the bubble sort algorithm occurs in Knuth's *The Art of Computer Programming: Sorting and Searching* to a 1956 paper (Friend, E. Sorting on electronic computer systems. *J.ACM 3* (1956), 134-168.)
Back then, the term "bubble sort" did not exist - in a 1959 book, *Programming Business Computers* by McCracken, Weiss, and Lee, the sorting algorithm was referred to as "exchange sorting. Similarly, the 1962 ACM Conference on Sorting used the phrase, "sorting by exchange."

The earliest use of the term "bubble sort" in print is probably in Iverson's 1962 book, *A Programming Language*, as theworks Iverson cited used terms other than "bubble sort" when referring to this algorithm.

In 1963, this algorithm was entered into the ACM algorithm repository as Algorithm 175 - Shuttle Sort (a name which appears to be synonymous with bidirectional bubble sort, or the cocktail shaker sort).
