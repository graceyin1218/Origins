# Hello World!

#### About
"Hello World!" is a program that simply prints the phrase "Hello World!" to console. It is a relatively simple program in most languages, and is often used to illustrate the syntax of a programming language.


#### History
Brian Kernighan, a Canadian computer scientist, wrote the first "Hello World!" program. "He first referenced ‘Hello World’ in the C Programming Language book’s predecessor: A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language B published in 1973" (Trikha).

Kernighan is well known for his book, The C Programming Language, and for devising the well known heuristics for the NP-complete problems, graph partitioning and the travelling salesman, with Shen Lin (the algorithms named Kernighan-Lin and Lin-Kernighan repectively) (Wikipedia).

He also "coined the term Unix" (Wikipedia).
