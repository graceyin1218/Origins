# Origins

### About

This is a collection of the origins of various serious and not-so-serious terms that most programmers have encountered. Theoretically. I initially wanted this to be a wiki ('cause hyperlinks are nice), but submitting pull requests on wikis doesn't appear to be a thing...

To be honest, I don't remember what prompted me to start this... All I remember was that we were reviewing open source licenses (specifically the GNU license, which mandates that anything that uses the open source library must be open source itself), and someone had asked whether sorting algorithms were licensed and whether using them meant that basically everything has to be open source. Something fantastical like that.

### Table of contents (or maybe it's more of an Index?)

##### Sorting algorithms
 - Bubble sort
 - Quicksort

##### Miscellaneous
 - Hello World
 - null pointer

### Something wrong or missing?

Well, hopefully it's not the former!! O:)

In either case, submit a pull request or open a new issue! If an issue is already open for the entry you want, +1 it or something, so others can guage its popularity. The more popular something appears, the more likely it'll be addressed first!


### Contributing

First look through the issues to see what people want to know about. You'll make the greatest impact if you find out the origins of one of those! :)

Some logistical things - when contributing...
 - Place your new entry in the appropriate folder (create a new one, if necessary)
 - Add a description of the thing whose origin you found
 - Add it to the Table of Contents (be sure to include the file path so people can find it!)
 - Sources!! (a url or the title/author of a book)

Have fun! :D
