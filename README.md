### Table of contents



### Something missing?
Submit a pull request or open a new issue! If an issue is already open for the entry you want, +1 it or something, so others can guage its popularity. The more popular something appears, the more likely it'll be addressed first!


### Contributing
First look at the issues to see what people want to know about. You'll have the greatest impact if you find out the origins of one of those! :)

Some logistical things - when contributing...
 - Place your new entry in the appropriate folder (create a new one, if necessary) 
 - Add a description of the thing whose origin you found
 - Add it to the Table of Contents 
 - Sources!! (a link or the title/author of a book)
 
Have fun! :D
