### Table of contents


### Contributing
First look at the issues to see what people want to know about. You'll have the greatest impact if you find out the origins of one of those! :)

Some logistical things - when contributing...
 - Place your new entry in the appropriate folder! (Create a new one, if necessary) 
 - Add it to the Table of Contents 
 - Include where you found this info (a link or the title/author of a book)
 
Have fun! :D
